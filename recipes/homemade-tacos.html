    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Homemade Tacos are the perfect busy weeknight dinner. These Easy Ground Beef Tacos are better than take-out and ready in minutes.</p>
    <p>Traditional Mexican beef tacos are made with marinated sliced or shredded beef on soft corn tortillas. Those are great!  But, that&rsquo;s not what most Americans think of when we think of classic tacos.</p>
    <p>Lean ground beef is the best beef to use for making tacos because you don&rsquo;t need to drain off any fat after cooking it. There is just enough fat in the beef to make it super flavorful, but not so much to make it greasy.  Skipping the step to drain the fat makes this a <b>quick and easy taco recipe</b>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef </li>
